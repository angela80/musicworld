      <h2>Jennifer Lopez </h2>
      <article>Jennifer Lopez is currently in the middle of her Las Vegas residency: All I Have, so of course (between her gigs, love life, and motherhood) she's super busy!
If for some reason you're a huge JLover but don't have the money or time to catch her show in at the Planet Hollywood in Vegas, there's a way you can see it on the small screen and from the comfort of your own home.
You see, the 48-year-old singer has just been announced as one of the performers at the 2018 Billboard Latin Music Awards.
According to an official press release, she's going to "give a special performance" which only makes us believe that her show will be a preview of what fans can expect in her residency show. After all, the awards show IS taking place in Vegas, very close to her residency—makes total sense!    
If that's not enough for you to go cray, in addition to JLo's performance, artists such as Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi (remember Despacito?), Colombian heartthrob Maluma, Latin boyband of the moment, CNCO, and the new queen of hip-hop, Cardi B, will all be there!

Don't miss out on this star-studded event at 7 p.m. ET on Thursday, April 26.</article>

      <article>With the new year in full swing, it’s time to look forward to the promise of new country and Americana album releases. From a rising Australian Americana artist to an outspoken Texas singer-songwriter, here are nine 2018 country albums to look forward to in the new year.Aussie-turned-Nashville-favorite Ruby Boots turned heads in Music City with her stellar 2016 sophomore album Solitude. Now she’s gearing up to release Don’t Talk About It on Bloodshot Records in early 2018. Taking inspiration from her homeland and all the places of her well-traveled life, Ruby Boots’ music is a mix of country soul and classic rock road warriors like Tom Petty. From the slowburning title track to the hard-rocking “It’s So Cruel,” Don’t Talk About It is sure to be one of the most exciting releases of 2018. 
     Los Angeles-based artist Sam Morrow has been one of the West Coast’s best kept country secrets for a few years now. But that’s all about to change with the release of his upcoming album Concrete and Mud, which is expected to put him in the national spotlight. Morrow channels the gritty soul of southern rock with a Cali-swagger that’s all his own.

      <p>Shortly before Troy Gentry’s tragic death in September, Montgomery Gentry recorded new music for their upcoming album Here’s to You, out Feb. 2. The duo’s final album, which will include the single “Better Me,” is expected to be an emotional and fitting tribute to the life, talent and legacy of Troy Gentry.</p>

    <article>Dance music is an emotional journey. It's how well you can make people feel something that they haven't felt.Trance is a very emotional and uplifting form of dance music. It appeals to many people in this way having such a strong connection with emotions. It makes people happy and ready to party.
   Dance music doesn't care where you live. It doesn't care who your friends are. It doesn't care how much money you make. It doesn't care if you're 74 or if you are 24 because... 74 is the new 24!
